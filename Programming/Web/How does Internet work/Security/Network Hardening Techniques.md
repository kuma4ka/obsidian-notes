**Definition:**  
**Network hardening** is the process of securing a network by **reducing vulnerabilities, limiting exposure, and enforcing strict access controls** to protect against attacks.

## **Key Techniques**  
- **Close unnecessary ports** and services ([Port Security Best Practices])  
- **Segment networks** to isolate critical systems ([Critical Service Isolation], [[LAN]], [[WAN]])  
- **Configure firewalls and ACLs** to control traffic ([Firewall Configuration])  
- **Enforce secure remote access** ([Secure Remote Access])  
- **Patch and update devices** regularly  
- **Monitor network traffic** for anomalies and potential intrusions  
- **Use strong authentication and encryption** for sensitive communications

**Notes:**  
- Network hardening combines multiple security measures into a **layered defense strategy**, minimizing risks and improving resilience.
