**Definition:**  
**Secure remote access** ensures that administrators and users can connect to systems remotely **without exposing networks to unnecessary risk**.

---

## **Key Methods**  
- Use **VPNs** or **encrypted tunnels** (e.g., SSL/TLS)  
- Prefer **encrypted remote management protocols** (e.g., WinRM HTTPS, RDP over TLS)  
- Restrict access by **IP, subnet, or user role**  
- Monitor and log all remote sessions
