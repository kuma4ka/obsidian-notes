A router is a device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding [data packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) to their intended [IP addresses](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/glossary/what-is-my-ip-address/), and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.

There are several types of routers, but most routers pass data between [LANs (local area networks)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-lan/) and [WANs (wide area networks)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-wan/). A LAN is a group of connected devices restricted to a specific geographic area. A LAN usually requires a single router.

A WAN, by contrast, is a large network spread out over a vast geographic area. Large organizations and companies that operate in multiple locations across the country, for instance, will need separate LANs for each location, which then connect to the other LANs to form a WAN. Because a WAN is distributed over a large area, it often necessitates multiple routers and switches*.
