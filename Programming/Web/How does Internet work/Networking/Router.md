**Definition:**  
A **router** is a network device that connects two or more **packet-switched networks or subnetworks**. It **forwards data packets** to their intended [[Internet Protocol (IP) Address]] and enables multiple devices to share the same Internet connection.

## **Primary Functions**
1. **Traffic Management**  
   - Forwards packets between networks based on destination IP addresses ([What is a packet?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/))  
   - Ensures efficient routing of data  

2. **Network Sharing**  
   - Allows multiple devices to use a single Internet connection  
   - Provides basic NAT (Network Address Translation) functionality

## **Types of Networks Connected**
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**  
  - Connects devices within a limited geographic area  
  - Typically requires **one router** per LAN  
  - [[LAN]]  

- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**  
  - Connects multiple LANs across a large geographic area  
  - Often requires **multiple routers and switches** to manage traffic  
  - [[WAN]]

## **Notes**
- Routers can be **hardware-based or software-based** (virtual routers).  
- Enterprise environments often use multiple routers to optimize network performance and reliability.  
- Routers operate primarily at **Layer 3 (Network Layer)** of the OSI model.
