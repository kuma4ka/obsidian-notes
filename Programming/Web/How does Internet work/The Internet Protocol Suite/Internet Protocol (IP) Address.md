**Definition:**  
An **Internet Protocol (IP) address** is a unique numeric identifier assigned to every device connected to the internet or a local network. It allows devices to send and receive information to a specific location.

**Purpose:**  
IP addresses are essential for routing data between devices. Each packet of information contains the source and destination IP addresses to ensure it reaches the correct device.

## **IP Versions**

1. **IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4):**  
   - Older standard, widely used  
   - 32-bit numeric address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)  
   - Supports approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses  

2. **IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6):**  
   - Newer standard to accommodate growing devices  
   - 128-bit numeric address (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)  
   - Supports trillions of addresses, suitable for IoT and modern networks

## **IP Address Types**

- **Public IP:** Accessible from the internet; unique globally  
- **Private IP:** Used within local networks; not routable on the internet  
- **Static IP:** Permanently assigned to a device  
- **Dynamic IP:** Assigned temporarily by a DHCP server

**Key Points:**  
- Every internet-connected device needs a unique IP for communication.  
- IPv6 adoption is increasing due to address exhaustion in IPv4.  
- Proper IP management is critical for network security and organization.
