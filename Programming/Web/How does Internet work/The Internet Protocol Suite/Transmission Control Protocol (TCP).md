**Definition:**  
The **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** is a communication standard that allows applications and devices to exchange messages over a network. TCP ensures that data is delivered **reliably and in order** between devices.

**Purpose:**  
- Sends **packets** across networks ([What is a packet?](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-packet-loss))  
- Guarantees **successful delivery** of data  
- Supports error-checking, retransmission, and flow control

## **Key Features of TCP**
- **Connection-oriented:** Establishes a connection before data transfer  
- **Reliable:** Confirms receipt of data and retransmits lost packets  
- **Ordered:** Ensures packets arrive in the correct sequence  
- **Error detection:** Uses checksums to detect corrupted data

**Usage Example:**  
- Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)  
- Email (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)  
- File transfers (FTP, SFTP)
