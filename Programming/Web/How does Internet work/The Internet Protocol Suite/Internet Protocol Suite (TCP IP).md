**Definition:**  
The **Internet Protocol Suite**, commonly known as **TCP/IP**, is a framework for organizing the communication protocols used in the **Internet** and similar **computer networks** according to functional criteria.

**Foundational Protocols:**  
- [[Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)]] – reliable, connection-oriented transport  
- [[UDP]] – connectionless, faster transport  
- [[Internet Protocol (IP) Address]] – addressing and routing of devices

## **History**
- Early versions were called the **Department of Defense (DoD) Internet Architecture Model**  
- Developed and funded by the **Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)** of the **U.S. Department of Defense**

## **Purpose**
- Provides a standardized framework for communication between devices  
- Defines rules for **packet delivery, addressing, and routing**  
- Supports interoperability across diverse hardware and networks
