Attackers often:

- Scan ports ([link to all ports](../6%20Top%2025%20Ports%20-%20Detailed%20Explanations%20and%20Best%20Practices))  
- Exploit unpatched services ([Port 445 SMB](../6.4%20DNS%20and%20NetBIOS%20Ports/Port%20445%20SMB.md))  
- Brute-force ([Port 22 SSH](../6.2%20File%20Transfer%20and%20Remote%20Access%20Ports/Port%2022%20SSH.md))  
- DoS attacks ([Port 53 DNS](../6.4%20DNS%20and%20NetBIOS%20Ports/Port%2053%20DNS.md))
