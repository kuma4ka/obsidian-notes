IANA defines three port ranges:

1. **Well-Known Ports (0–1023)**: Standard services (HTTP, FTP, DNS)  
2. **Registered Ports (1024–49151)**: Assigned to user processes or apps  
3. **Dynamic/Private Ports (49152–65535)**: Ephemeral and client-side connections

This helps identify which ports are critical and which may be repurposed or disabled.
