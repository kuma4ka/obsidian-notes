**Definition:**  
This node outlines **common attack patterns** and **misconfigurations** that can expose network services and ports to compromise.

---

## **Common Attack Patterns**

1. **Default Configurations**  
   - Services running with default settings can be exploited.  
   - Examples: [[Port 80 – HTTP]], [[Port 443 – HTTPS]], [[Port 22 – SSH]], [[Port 445 – SMB]]  

2. **Weak Authentication & Unpatched Services**  
   - Weak passwords, reused credentials, or outdated software increase vulnerability.  
   - Regular patching and strong authentication mitigate risks.  

3. **Brute-Force Attacks**  
   - Targeted attacks to guess credentials, especially on [[Port 22 – SSH]].  
   - Can be mitigated using rate-limiting, 2FA, and IP restrictions.

**Notes:**  
- Always review default configurations when deploying new services.  
- Combine monitoring, patching, and strong authentication to reduce exposure.
