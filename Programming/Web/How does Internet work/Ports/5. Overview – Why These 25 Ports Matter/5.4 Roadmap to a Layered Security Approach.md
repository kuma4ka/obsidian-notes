**Definition:**  
A **layered security approach** (defense-in-depth) implements multiple, complementary controls to **reduce risk and protect critical assets**.

---

## **Core Layers**

1. **Configuration**  
   - Harden services by disabling unnecessary features and changing default settings.  

2. **Authentication**  
   - Use strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control.  

3. **Segmentation**  
   - Isolate critical systems using VLANs, firewalls, and network ACLs to limit lateral movement.  

4. **Monitoring**  
   - Log and analyze network traffic to detect suspicious activity early.  
   - Employ intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).  

5. **Vulnerability Assessment**  
   - Regularly scan for misconfigurations, unpatched software, and weak services.  
   - Prioritize remediation based on risk.

**Notes:**  
- Combining layers ensures that **if one control fails, others provide protection**.  
- Regular review and updates are essential for maintaining effectiveness.
