## Purpose
The attack surface represents all possible entry points an attacker could exploit. By minimizing open ports and restricting services, organizations reduce opportunities for compromise and strengthen overall security.

## Key Actions

### 1. Close All Unused Ports
- Perform regular port scans to detect unnecessary open ports.  
- Validate with system and application owners before disabling services.  
- Reference: [Service Categories and Their Importance](obsidian://open?vault=Programming&file=Web%2FHow%20does%20Internet%20work%2FPorts%2F5.%20Overview%20%E2%80%93%20Why%20These%2025%20Ports%20Matter%2F5.1%20Service%20Categories%20and%20Their%20Importance)  

### 2. Adopt a "Default-Deny" Policy
- Block all ports by default at firewalls and host-based security controls.  
- Explicitly allow only required business services.  
- Continuously review exceptions to ensure they remain justified.  

### 3. Reduce Service Exposure
- Limit port availability to specific IP ranges or internal networks.  
- Segregate high-value assets into secure network segments.  
- Disable or replace insecure legacy protocols (e.g., [[Port 23 – Telnet]] → [[Port 22 – SSH]]).

## Best Practices
- Automate scanning with tools like Nmap, Nessus, or OpenVAS.  
- Maintain an **inventory of approved services** with business justification.  
- Regularly audit and log changes to port configurations.  
- Integrate with vulnerability management to quickly address newly exposed services.
