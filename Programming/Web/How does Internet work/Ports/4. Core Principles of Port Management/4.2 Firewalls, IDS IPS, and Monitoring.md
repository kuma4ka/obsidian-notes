## Purpose
Firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) form the backbone of port security. Combined with continuous monitoring, they filter, detect, and respond to suspicious activity, reducing the likelihood of successful attacks.

## Key Actions

### 1. Filter Traffic
- Enforce rules based on **IP address, port, and protocol**.  
- Apply "default-deny" and allow only explicitly approved traffic.  
- Use both **network firewalls** and **host-based firewalls** for layered defense.  

### 2. Deploy IDS/IPS
- IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) → monitor traffic and alert on suspicious behavior.  
- IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems) → block malicious traffic in real time.  
- Regularly update signatures and detection rules.

### 3. Review Logs and Set Alerts
- Centralize logs from firewalls, IDS/IPS, and servers.  
- Define alert thresholds (e.g., repeated failed logins on [[Port 22 – SSH]]).  
- Use SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platforms for correlation and analysis.

## Best Practices
- Perform **regular rule audits** to remove outdated or overly broad rules.  
- Segment monitoring dashboards for **critical vs. non-critical ports**.  
- Simulate attacks (e.g., penetration testing) to validate detection capabilities.  
- Train staff to respond quickly to alerts and incidents.
