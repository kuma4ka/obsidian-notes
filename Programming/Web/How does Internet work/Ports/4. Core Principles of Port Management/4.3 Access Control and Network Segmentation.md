**Definition:**  
Access control and network segmentation are strategies to **restrict access to critical resources** and **limit potential attack surfaces** by dividing the network into isolated segments.

## **Best Practices**

1. **Segment Networks**  
   - Isolate critical services and sensitive data from general user networks.  
   - Use VLANs or firewalls to enforce separation.  

2. **Use Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
   - Restrict access to services by **IP, port, or protocol**.  
   - Example critical ports:  
     - [[Port 445 – SMB]]  
     - [Port 3389 – RDP](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/common-ports/what-is-port-3389)  

3. **Monitor Traffic Between Segments**  
   - Log and analyze traffic to detect unauthorized access attempts.  
   - Use intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS) where possible.

**Notes:**  
- Proper segmentation reduces lateral movement in case of a breach.  
- ACLs should follow the principle of **least privilege**.
