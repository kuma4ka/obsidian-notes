Open ports increase your network's attack surface. Each open port can be a potential entry point for attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the associated service.  

- Example: SMB ([Port 445](../6%20Top%2025%20Ports%20-%20Detailed%20Explanations%20and%20Best%20Practices/6.4%20DNS%20and%20NetBIOS%20Ports/Port%20445%20SMB.md)) can be exploited by malware like WannaCry ([1.3 Threat Landscape and Historical Incidents](1.3%20Threat%20Landscape%20and%20Historical%20Incidents.md))  
- Proper port security ([3 Planning a Port Security Strategy](../3%20Planning%20a%20Port%20Security%20Strategy)) protects sensitive data and ensures system availability.
