- Common examples: HTTP ([Port 80](obsidian://open?vault=Programming&file=Web%2FHow%20does%20Internet%20work%2FPorts%2F6.%20Top%2025%20Ports%20%E2%80%93%20Detailed%20Explanations%20and%20Best%20Practices%2F6.1%20Web%20and%20HTTP-S%20Related%20Ports%2FPort%2080%20%E2%80%93%20HTTP)), HTTPS ([Port 443](obsidian://open?vault=Programming&file=Web%2FHow%20does%20Internet%20work%2FPorts%2F6.%20Top%2025%20Ports%20%E2%80%93%20Detailed%20Explanations%20and%20Best%20Practices%2F6.1%20Web%20and%20HTTP-S%20Related%20Ports%2FPort%20443%20%E2%80%93%20HTTPS))

- Ports work with TCP ([2.1 TCP vs UDP and the OSI Model](obsidian://open?vault=Programming&file=Web%2FHow%20does%20Internet%20work%2FPorts%2F2.%20Fundamental%20Concepts%20and%20Threat%20Landscape%2F2.1%20TCP%20vs%20UDP%20and%20the%20OSI%20Model)) and UDP protocols to ensure data packets reach the correct application.
