Network ports are logical endpoints that allow devices to communicate over the Internet or local networks. Each port number (0â€“65,535) identifies a specific service or process. 

- Common examples: HTTP ([Port 80](../6%20Top%2025%20Ports%20-%20Detailed%20Explanations%20and%20Best%20Practices/6.1%20Web%20and%20HTTP-S%20Related%20Ports/Port%2080%20HTTP.md)), HTTPS ([Port 443](../6%20Top%2025%20Ports%20-%20Detailed%20Explanations%20and%20Best%20Practices/6.1%20Web%20and%20HTTP-S%20Related%20Ports/Port%20443%20HTTPS.md))

- Ports work with TCP ([2.1 TCP vs UDP and the OSI Model](../2%20Fundamental%20Concepts%20and%20Threat%20Landscape/2.1%20TCP%20vs%20UDP%20and%20the%20OSI%20Model.md)) and UDP protocols to ensure data packets reach the correct application.
