## Purpose
Securing ports effectively requires collaboration between different stakeholders, since ports touch many aspects of IT infrastructure—networking, servers, applications, compliance, and security monitoring.

## Key Actions

### 1. Close All Unused Ports
- Perform regular scans to detect unnecessary open ports.  
- Validate findings with system/application owners to avoid disrupting business services.  
- Reference: [[6 Top 25 Ports – Detailed Explanations and Best Practice]]

### 2. Adopt a "Default-Deny" Policy
- Block all ports and protocols by default.  
- Explicitly allow only the ports required for business operations.  
- Ensure firewall and IDS/IPS rules reflect this principle.  

### 3. Engage Stakeholders
- **System Administrators:** Validate which services must remain active.  
- **Application Owners:** Confirm application dependencies on specific ports.  
- **Network Teams:** Implement firewall/ACL changes and maintain monitoring.  
- **Security/Compliance Teams:** Ensure changes align with regulations (ISO, PCI-DSS).  
- **Management:** Approve risk-based exceptions when business needs outweigh restrictions.

## Best Practices
- Establish **change management workflows** to review port modifications.  
- Maintain an **approved services list** tied to documented business justifications.  
- Communicate risks clearly to non-technical stakeholders (impact vs. risk).  
- Review port configurations during **regular audits** to ensure continued compliance.
