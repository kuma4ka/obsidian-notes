## Purpose
Risk analysis helps prioritize which ports and services require the most attention. Since not all ports pose the same level of threat, applying structured methodologies ensures resources are allocated effectively.

## Common Frameworks

### ðŸ”¹ NIST SP 800-30
- Provides a **systematic process** for risk assessment.  
- Focus areas: threat sources, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact.  
- Supports both qualitative and quantitative analysis.  

### ðŸ”¹ ISO 27001
- International standard for **information security management systems (ISMS)**.  
- Requires identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks.  
- Focuses on continuous improvement (Planâ€“Doâ€“Checkâ€“Act cycle).  

### ðŸ”¹ PCI-DSS
- Security standard for protecting **payment card data**.  
- Requires strict control of services and ports to prevent unauthorized access.  
- Relevant for any system handling financial transactions.

## Practical Application to Ports
- **Prioritize by criticality:**  
  - Ports exposing sensitive services (e.g., [[Port 443 â€“ HTTPS]], [[Port 22 â€“ SSH]]) should be hardened.  
  - High-risk, insecure services (e.g., [[Port 23 â€“ Telnet]]) should be disabled or replaced.  

- **Assess potential damage:**  
  - Unauthorized access to management ports (e.g., RDP on [Port 3389 RDP](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/common-ports/what-is-port-3389)) could compromise entire systems.  
  - Open database ports (e.g., [Port 3306 MySQL](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/common-ports/what-is-port-3306)) may lead to data breaches.  

- **Balance risk vs. business needs:**  
  - Not all open ports can be closedâ€”focus on securing those that are business-critical.

## Best Practices
- Conduct risk assessments **regularly** (at least annually or after major changes).  
- Document findings and mitigation steps.  
- Integrate results into overall **port security strategy**.  
- Align with compliance requirements to avoid legal or financial penalties.
