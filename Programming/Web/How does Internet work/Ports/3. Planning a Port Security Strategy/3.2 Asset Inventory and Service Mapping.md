## Purpose
Understanding **what devices and services exist** in your environment is the foundation of effective port security. Without visibility, it’s impossible to assess risks or enforce controls.

## Steps

### 1. Inventory Devices and Services
- Catalog all devices: servers, endpoints, routers, IoT, cloud workloads.  
- Record key attributes: IP address, hostname, operating system, function.  
- Include third-party integrations and virtual environments.  

### 2. Map Services to Ports
- Identify which services are bound to which ports.  
- Pay close attention to critical services (e.g., [[Port 443 – HTTPS]], [[Port 22 – SSH]], [Port 3389 RDP](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/common-ports/what-is-port-3389)).
