## Goals
When planning a port security strategy, itâ€™s critical to establish clear objectives:
- **Reduce attack surface:** Minimize open and unused ports to limit exposure.  
- **Ensure compliance:** Align with regulatory frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA).  
- **Improve performance:** Remove unnecessary services that consume bandwidth or system resources.  
- **Enhance monitoring:** Define which ports are mission-critical so they can be prioritized in log analysis and alerts.  

---

## Scope
The scope determines **where and how deeply** port security controls will be applied:
- **Entire network:** Comprehensive review across all devices, including endpoints, servers, IoT, and cloud workloads.  
- **Critical servers only:** Focus on high-value assets (databases, domain controllers, application servers).  
- **Specific environments:** Limit scope to production, staging, or development systems depending on risk appetite.  
- **External vs. internal exposure:** Prioritize externally facing ports first, then assess internal segmentation.

## Documentation
To maintain clarity and accountability:
- Record **goals, scope, and assumptions** in a central document.  
- Define **success metrics** (e.g., number of closed ports, percentage of compliant servers).  
- Assign **ownership** (who is responsible for monitoring, patching, and enforcing controls).  
- Revisit objectives periodically as the business and threat landscape evolve.
